first: git init, make files, git add --a >>now they staged
2nd: do some changes in one of files     >>file goes in working area.i.e. modified; now the same file will be in staging area and working directory.
     latest modified file is not staged, old one is staged, so u can:
3rd: run just >> git diff

//now u can see changes: what added or deleted
